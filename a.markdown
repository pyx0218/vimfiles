-----------------------------------
This github project contains some essential plugins for VIM, you can just put them in the**~/.vim**directory and copy the file**.vimrc**to ~,then most of them will work, and some needed further installation. 

One of such is LanguageTool which can check whether your article is elegant(At first I thought it is a spell-checking plugin which is already a part with Vim.).I feel it is of no use, then if you need, you can download it from [This](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3223)
