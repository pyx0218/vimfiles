Milannic's Vim(GVim) Configuration(Milannic Cheng Liu@2014)
===================================
***All the resources are downloaded legally from web with notification by me you can modify them freely***

1.Description
-----------------------------------
This github project contains some essential plugins for VIM, you can just put them in the**~/.vim**directory and copy the file**.vimrc**to ~,then most of them will work, and some needed further installation. 

One of such is LanguageTool which can check whether your article is elegant(At first I thought it is a spell-checking plugin which is already a part with Vim.).I feel it is of no use, then if you need, you can download it from [This](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3223)


2.Ctags and Cscope
-----------------------------------
Ctags can generate tag file for your source code, and Cscope can provide you functions such as looking up where this function is called, or this structure is defined.
***but what you need to know is that no matter how good it looks,it is still a little baby compared to big IDE in parsing the code***
And you need to install them by your own.
For Ubuntu User, you can simply apt-get them, ctags and cscope.
For Mac User, you can use brew.


3.Main Plugin
------------------------------------
#Pydict
python complete plugin, mainly use for lib function for python is a dynamic language.
#Latex-Suite
Maybe the best latex plugin in vim, the mark is very convenient.
#NerdTree
A file explorer in vim
#MiniBufExplorer
MultiTab in vim, used to manage multiple open file.
#Javacomplete
a very good java complete plugin, the first time it will generate a parser file from your system java lib.
#C-Vim
C/C++ plugin
#taglist
show all the functions of the current source file
#Rails
rails plugin
#ZenCodingforVIM
A famous HTML editor plugin.


4.Maybe for daily use no more needed.
------------------------------------
The way to use them you can check the tool bar, it should have keyshort tips. 
For completion, you can tray <C-x>i,<C-x>p,<C-x>n and <C-x>l(complete a line)(either keyshort has its own property,but i cannot remember).

Have a good day.
